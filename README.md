# Priority-Queue-Navigation-Alpp
The same app but using priority queue instead of brute force


The task:

In addition to Task I, this time the order of x points is 
important as well for an example output of only ((-1, 1), (3, 3)) should be accepted.
To achieve this you have to implement your own Max Priority Queue, without using 
java.util.PriorityQueue library.

For this task, a user will give you an array with n elements as an input, and a number x 
to show how many travel locations the users need. With this information, you need to 
return x number of closest locations to the point of (0, 0).
Example Case:
Input From the user: [[1,20],[-2,2],[8,-8],[11,-9]]
3
Output: [[-2,2],[8,-8],[11,-9]]
